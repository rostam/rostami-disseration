                and time-consuming process. Therefore, it is beneficial to complement this
                process by gradually integrating elements from parallel computing into
                existing courses that were previously designed without parallelism in mind.
                As an example, we propose the multiplication of a sparse matrix by a dense
                vector on parallel computers with distributed memory. A novel educational
                module is introduced that illustrates the intimate connection between
                distributing the data of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication to
                parallel processes and partitioning a suitably defined graph. This
                web-based module aims at better involving undergraduate students in the

                  out to be extremely expensive and risky. Thus, it is of great importance
                  to work out the details of suitable borehole locations in advance. Here,
                  given a set of existing boreholes, we demonstrate how a sophisticated
                  numerical technique called optimal experimental design helps to find a
                  location of an additional exploratory borehole that reduces risk and,
                  ultimately, saves cost. More precisely, the approach minimizes the
                  uncertainty when deducing the effective permeability of a buried
                  reservoir layer from a temperature profile measured in this exploratory
                  borehole. In this paper, we (1) outline the mathematical formulation in
                  terms of an optimization problem, (2) describe the numerical
                  implementation involving various software components, and (3) apply the
                  method to a 3D numerical simulation model representing a real geothermal
                  reservoir in northern Italy. Our results show that optimal experimental
                  design is conceptually and computationally feasible for industrial-scale
                  applications. For the particular reservoir and the estimation of
                  permeability from temperature, the optimal location of the additional
                  borehole coincides with regions of high flow rates and large deviations
                  from the mean temperature of the reservoir layer in question. Finally,
                  the presentation shows that, methodologically, the optimization method
                  can be generalized from estimating permeability to finding any other
                  reservoir properties.",

                  surprising that inverse problems are often solved using techniques from
                  high-performance computing. We consider the parallelization of an inverse problem
                  in the field of geothermal reservoir engineering. In this particular scientific
                  application, the underlying software package is already parallelized using the
                  shared-memory programming paradigm OpenMP. Here, we present an extension of this
                  parallelization to distributed memory enabling a hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization.
                  The situation is different from the standard way of hybrid parallel programming
                  because the data structures of the OpenMP-parallelized code differ from those in
                  the serial implementation. We exploit this transformation of the data structures in
                  our distributed-memory strategy for parallelizing an ensemble Kalman filter, a
                  particular method for the solution of inverse problems. We describe this novel
                  parallelization strategy, introduce a performance model, and present timing results
                  on a compute cluster using nodes with 2 sockets, each equipped with Intel Xeon
                  X5675 Westmere EP processors with 6 cores. All timing results are obtained with a
                  pure MPI parallelization without using any OpenMP threads.",

                 science and engineering. The underlying concepts of parallel computing affect and

                 algorithms, and networking, to name a few. Parallel algorithms for problems arising
                 from scientific computing often involve some combinatorial aspects too. In
                 particular, there is an intimate connection between graph theory and sparse linear
                 algebra. A seemingly serial formulation of a sparse Cholesky factorization can be
                 transformed into a block matrix formulation exhibiting parallelism. This
                 transformation is known as nested dissection ordering and can be expressed in terms
                 of a vertex separator in a suitably defined graph. This paper presents the design
                 and implementation of a novel interactive educational model illustrating this
                 connection for classroom use. The educational module also includes some

                  important questions in industrial geothermal engineering is how to determine a
                  suitable location for a borehole to extract thermal energy. We argue that this
                  question can be tackled by a set of advanced numerical techniques known as optimal
                  experimental design. More precisely, we formulate the problem of finding a borehole
                  for a given geological reservoir in terms of a mathematical optimization problem.
                  We demonstrate that today numerical solutions of such practically relevant
                  geothermal engineering problems are manageable by bringing together complementary
                  skills from geophysics, mathematics, and computer science. The EFCOSS framework is
                  designed for the solution of optimization problems with an emphasis on optimal
                  experimental design and distributed computing. In this work, we redesign EFCOSS to
                  improve its usability for engineering problems. The overall methodology is applied
                  to a two-dimensional reservoir engineering problem of practical interest. We
                  determine the position of boreholes in a reservoir in western Australia such that
                  the uncertainty of estimating the hydraulic permeability from temperature
                  measurements is minimized. Our findings show that the solution of this challenging
                  optimization problem is feasible. However, there is still room for further research

                  later be needed to compute the partial derivatives of the corresponding statement.
                  The stored information will be accessed in reverse order of being written. This
                  runs contrary to many assumptions made in standard implementations of file systems,

                  aimed at speeding up future read requests is to employ read-ahead. This strategy
                  is useful for accesses in forward direction but is considered to be harmful to the

                zur Anwendung gebracht. Am Beispiel von zwei Walzstrategien (A und B) f{\"u}r
                niedriglegierten C-Mn Stahl wird so die Sensitivit{\"a}t der Walzkraft in
                Abh{\"a}ngigkeit der Material- und Prozessparameter ermittelt. Die Ergebnisse
                quantifizieren die Einflusscharakteristik der einzelnen Parameter in den
                jeweiligen Phasen des Walzprozesses und erm{\"o}glichen so eine Aussage {\"u}ber die
                Bedeutung der einzelnen Parameter f{\"u}r die Ergebnisgenauigkeit der Modellrechnung.",
   abstractEng="Consistent modelling of multi-pass hot rolling processes has to account for numerous
                interdependencies within the process. With a growing number of passes, the sensitivity
                of the model output with respect to variations in the input parameters plays a vital
                role for assessing the accuracy and stability of the computation. This study details
                a new concept of using Automatic Differentiation (AD) to obtain exact derivatives of
                the output values of the numerical model for plate rolling. It is shown that the
                sensitivities of the roll force with respect to selected material and process parameters
                can be computed through AD technology. As use case the rolling of plain C-Mn steel plate
                is analyzed in two different strategies (A and B). The results show substantial
                differences in the influence characteristics of particular input parameters and
                thereby allow for a quantitative assessment of the parameters’ importance in every
                phase of the rolling process.",

               key technology for the numerical solution of large-scale problems
               arising in computational science and engineering (CSE). The authors
               believe that principles and techniques of parallel programming are
               among the essential ingredients of any CSE as well as computer science
               curriculum. Today, opinions on the role and importance of parallel
               programming are diverse. Rather than seeing it as a marginal beneficial
               skill optionally taught at the graduate level, we understand parallel
               programming as crucial basic skill that should be taught as an
               integral part of the undergraduate computer science curriculum. A
               practical training course developed for computer science
               undergraduates at Aachen University is described. Its
               goal is to introduce young computer science students to different
               parallel programming paradigms for shared and distributed memory
               computers as well as to give a first exposition to the field of
               computational science by simple, yet carefully chosen sample problems.",
